# Analysis Partition Clustering Algorithm and Proximity Measure on Alquran Verses
Comparsion and analysis of partition clustering algorithm such as: k-means, bisecting k-means, and k-medoid with different proximity measure: cosine, jaccard, and correlation coefficient on al-quran verses in Indonesian and was presented on International Conference on Telematics and Wireless (ICWT) in Jogjakarta, Indonesia on July, 2019.
This project was inspired by a journal: "Finding Similar Documents using Different Clustering Techiques" by Sumayia Al-Anazi, Hind AlMahmoud, and Isra Al-Turaiki.
